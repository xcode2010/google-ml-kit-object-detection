# Maybe one day I could do this course and become really good at computer vision?

I registered with OpenCV.com course was not open, I had to then enroll, clever trick. I could use this technique to solcit people to want to buy the course, then when I can justify enough interest I can release the course. It is also a way to elongate a queue like in the good ole days of lining up to enter a club. You wait for ages, and the club is mostly empty.

LOL.
